OptiKey is designed to work on single monitor setups only. Attempting to move it between monitors, or across multiple monitors will almost certainly result in incorrect behaviour. This is a common limitation with eye tracking devices and not something I can solve quickly, although I may attempt a solution at some point.

OptiKey 被设计成只能工作在单显示器环境下。试图在显示器间移动它，或者跨多个显示器会导致不正常的行为。这是眼球跟踪设备的一个常见限制，以后我可能会解决这个问题，但现在不行。
