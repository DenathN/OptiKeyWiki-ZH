OptiKey is designed to work on single monitor setups only. Attempting to move it between monitors, or across multiple monitors will almost certainly result in incorrect behaviour. This is a common limitation with eye tracking devices and not something I can solve quickly, although I may attempt a solution at some point.

OptiKey 被设计成只能工作在单显示器环境下。试图在显示器间移动它，或者跨多个显示器会导致不正常的行为。这是眼动仪的一个常见限制，以后我可能会解决这个问题，但现在不行。

It is possible to use OptiKey on a monitor with a mirrored setup (both monitor and laptop showing the same screen), but when you first set it up you may experience incorrect behaviour in the size and position of OptiKey. To work around this, plug in your monitor, change your display settings to mirror the display and then **restart your computer**.
