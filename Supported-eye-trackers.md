³ The EyeTech TM5 is not currently supported, but instead it can be used to control the cursor position which can in turn can control OptiKey, as shown in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M7FVBuMcec

**Other input methods:**

OptiKey is designed to be used with an eye tracker, but you do not need one. 

If you have an eye tracker which isn't yet fully supported, you may be able to use [mouse emulation](https://github.com/JuliusSweetland/OptiKey/wiki/Using-mouse-emulation) to control OptiKey.

You can also control OptiKey with a standard mouse, or [use a webcam](https://github.com/JuliusSweetland/OptiKey/wiki/Using-webcams) if you want to try it out.

Adding full support for new eye trackers may be possible - if you have an unsupported tracker then get in touch and I will see what I can do: [optikeyfeedback@gmail.com](mailto:optikeyfeedback@gmail.com)
